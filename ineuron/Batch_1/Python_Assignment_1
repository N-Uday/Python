Q1.   General purpose programming language is can be used in variety of applications and not bound 
      to particular purpose, As PYTHON is used to perform  different programs and not bound to specific
	  programs. PYTHON is a user-oriented language it is called as high level programming language..
	  
Q2.   In PYTHON we don't mention datatype before declaring variable as it is taken care by python at run
      time, so it is called as dynamically typed program..
	  
Q3.   PROS - 1. Friendly Language easy to write and understand compared to other languages.
             2. Large number of libraries 
	  	   3. Can be used in many functions like ML,Data field as less number of code lines ...
	  	   
	  CONS - 1. As it is a interpreter language,it is slower than compiled languages.
             2. Runtime errors..
	  	   
Q4.   PYTHON can be used in Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Deep learning,BIG-DATA..
	  
Q5.   A variable in python is the memory location of an object or a pointer for that object and 
      it declaration must start with a letter or underscore(_) ...
	  
Q6.   we can take input from user in python by using input() function which is inbuilt function 
      in python.
	  
Q7.   When we use input() function the default type it takes is STRING value.
	  
Q8.   Converting one datatype to another datatype based on requirement by declaring required
      datatype before the actual datatype like casting string input to integer by 	
      int(input()) or  int(str)...
	  
Q9.   NO, using one input() function can enter a long string or a integer value, different 
      inputs at a time can't be taken, we have to use input() for every different input..
	  
Q10.  Keywords are reserved words in python,which can't be used to declare variables,functions.
      some of keywords are TRUE,FALSE,NONE,PASS, ...etc.
	
Q11.  NO,keywords have distinct functionlity and it can't be assigned to a variable.

Q12.  Indentation is giving blank spaces before a block of code.As PYTHON  is a interpreter 
      language, interpreter can identify the indentated spaces and consider those code belong to 
	  particular block..

Q13.  We can display output using print() function in python..
	 
Q14.  Operators are used to perform arithmetical and logical operations.some operators are
      +,-,*,/,=,<,> .. etc
	  
Q15.  Division(/) gives regular result when a number is divided by other number 
      while in Floor division(//) flooring means reducing point values to lowest number and gives
	  integer values,
	  eg.  5/2=2.5    but  5//2 =2 #as it is flooring to lowest integer..
	  
Q16.  a="iNeuron"
      print(a*4)
	  
Q17.  number=int(input("Enter a number: "))
      if(number%2)==0:
	     print("EVEN")
	  else:
	     print("ODD")
		 
Q18.  Boolean operators return TRUE/FALSE based on the condition.
      some opearators are ==,!=,>,<,etc...
	  
Q19.  1
      0
	  False
	  1
	  
Q20.  Conditional Statements are a block of code which executes only when the condition is satisfied.

Q21.  if,elif,else are conditional statements used to get required output from a wide range of values.
      these statements are indepedent if one conditional statement fails then it falls for next conditional 
	  statement like if fails now code goes to elif even it fails finally else code executes.
	  
Q22.  age =int(input("Enter age: ")
      if age>=18:
	     print("I can vote")
	  else: 
	     print("I can't vote")
		 
Q23.  even_list=[i for i in numbers if i%2==0]
      print(even_list)
	  
Q24.  li=[]
      for i in range(0,3):
          li.append(int(input("Enter number: "))) 
      print("Maximum number out of three is",max(li))  

Q25.  numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
      for i in numbers:
          if i==150:
              continue
          elif i>500:
              break
          elif(i%5)==0:
              print(i)
